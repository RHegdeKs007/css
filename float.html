        Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is a flowering plant species
            of the Cucurbitaceae family. A scrambling and trailing vine-like
            plant, it was originally domesticated in Africa. It is a highly
            cultivated fruit worldwide, with more than 1,000 varieties.
            Wild watermelon seeds have been found in the prehistoric
            Libyan site of Uan Muhuggiag.
            [2] There is also evidence from
            seeds in Pharaoh tombs of watermelon cultivation in Ancient
            Egypt.
            Watermelon is grown in favorable climates from tropical to
            temperate regions worldwide for its large edible fruit, which is
            a berry with a hard rind and no internal divisions, and is
            botanically called a pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh is usually deep
            red to pink, with many black seeds, although seedless varieties
            exist. The fruit can be eaten raw or pickled, and the rind is
            edible after cooking. It may also be consumed as a juice or as
            an ingredient in mixed beverages.
            Considerable breeding effort has developed disease-resistant
            varieties. Many cultivars are available that produce mature
            fruit within 100 days of planting. In 2017, China produced
            about two-thirds of the world total of watermelons</p>
