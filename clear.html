        <p>  The papaya is a small, sparsely branched tree, usually with a single stem growing from 5 to 10 m (16
            to 33 ft) tall, with spirally arranged leaves confined to the top of the trunk. The lower trunk is
            conspicuously scarred where leaves and fruit were borne. The leaves are large, 50–70 cm (20–28 in)
            in diameter, deeply palmately lobed, with seven lobes. All parts of the plant contain latex in
            articulated laticifers.[6] Papayas are dioecious. The flowers are five-parted and highly dimorphic; the
            male flowers have the stamens fused to the petals. The female flowers have a superior ovary and five
            contorted petals loosely connected at the base.[7]:235 Male and female flowers are borne in the leaf 
            axils, and the males are multiflowered dichasia, and the female flowers are in few-flowered dichasia.
            The pollen grains are elongated and approximately 35 microns in length. The flowers are sweetscented, 
            open at night, and wind- or insect-pollinate</p>
